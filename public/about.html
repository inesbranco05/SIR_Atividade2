        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This project was developed by <strong>InÃªs Branco</strong>, a 21-year-old student of Computer Engineering. The goal of this project is to build a RESTful API to manage information for a fictitious application.</p>
        <p>The application supports the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and uses the lowDB library to persist data in a JSON file. The system manages "students" with information such as name, course, and year of study.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, the project uses Express.js for the API routes and is designed in a modular way for easy maintenance and scalability.</p>
